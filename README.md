# PoliceDataChallenge2017
Team Members: Ishan Saraf, Nick Harrelson

Team Sponsor: Dr. Eric Reyes

This repository contains all scripts and files associated with our team submission for the 2017 Police Data Challenge. Details can be found at the [Police Data Challenge website](http://thisisstatistics.org/policedatachallenge/).

Prior to running any R Scripts, the Calls for Service dataset should be downloaded as a .csv file from [here](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safer-Streets/PDI-Police-Calls-For-Service-CAD-/gexm-h6bt) and added to the "Data" folder.
