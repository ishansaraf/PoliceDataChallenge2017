# PoliceDataChallenge2017
Team Members: Ishan Saraf, Nick Harrelson

Team Sponsor: Dr. Eric Reyes

This repository contains all scripts and files associated with our team submission for the 2017 Police Data Challenge. Details can be found at the [Police Data Challenge website](http://thisisstatistics.org/policedatachallenge/).

Prior to running any R Scripts, the Calls for Service dataset should be downloaded as a .csv file from [here](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safer-Streets/PDI-Police-Calls-For-Service-CAD-/gexm-h6bt) and added to the "Data" folder.

The Data folder contains our data sets, both initial and intermediate, alongside the visualizations created as part of the project. In addition, it also has some .RData files that we used to avoid having to rerun lengthy computations.

The RScripts folder contains all the R code used in making this project. It should be noted that the Force Incident Visualization script was for an earlier iteration of the project that was later abandoned.

Lastly, the Presentations folder contains our final report.
